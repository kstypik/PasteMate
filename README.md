## Getting Started

Clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/kstypik/PasteMate.git .
```

Install the dependencies (PasteMate uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as a package manager):

```
poetry install
```

Set required environment variable for development (for production there is more, see production settings module).
You can create .env file in the project's base directory with your environment variables (don't forget to replace placeholder data with your own Postgres credentials:

```
DATABASE_URL=psql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DBNAME>
```

Apply migrations:

```
poetry run python manage.py makemigrations && poetry run python manage.py migrate
```

Install the Node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Build the [CodeMirror](codemirror.net/) editor:

```
npm start
```

Optionally, you can fill the database with examplary data:

```
poetry run python manage.py reset_test_user && poetry run python manage.py generate_demo_pastes
```

Now you can start the development server:

```
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

**Note:** To support paste expiration feature, you have to add expire_pastes Django management command to your cron tasks or to another scheduler.

Happy coding!
